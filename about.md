Hi, I'm Dylan Redmond.

I'm a Graduate `Cloud Automation Engineer` based in Dublin, Ireland. I am currently working for [Paddy Power Betfair](https://www.paddypowerbetfair.com/).

I studied Electronic and Computer Engineering at [Dublin City University](https://www.dcu.ie/).

I have been with PPB since January 2017 where I joined the Football Exchange Operations team on a part-time basis.
In this role I was responsible for managing the in-play [Exchange](https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/football) markets for the highest profile matches across World Football.

In my spare time, you can find me Refereeing football in Dublin across the [NDSL](http://ndsl.ie/) and [Airtricity Underage Leagues](http://www.sseairtricityleague.ie/).

I also love to watch football, play Football Manager and games of chance.
